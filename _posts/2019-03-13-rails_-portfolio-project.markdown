#### For my Rails portfolio project i decided to create a fitness cms where users can upload different workouts and the description of the workout. Eventually i would like to allow user to upload photos and create workout routines, maybe even meal plans. I've use the Ruby on Rails framework from scratch and some javascript to make it alittle pretty lol. 
#### This project took me some time, i had to look to many sources to help me understand really what i was doing. It was tough and i felt like i've it a wall but i wouldnt allow myself to quit,I finally completed this project and ready to continue this course. I'm excited to get to the next step!

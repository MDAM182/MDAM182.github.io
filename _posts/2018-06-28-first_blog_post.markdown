#### Sup! Welcome to my first blog post, please spare my grammactial errors ðŸ˜‚
#### I suppose i will start off with the suggested topic.

### Q: 

Why did you decide to learn software development?

### A: 

The main reason i decied to become a software developer was to find purpose. I never saw myself actually taking on this

challenge because it seemed so foreign to me. I did'nt think i had the "brains" to become a devloper honestly, but after i 

did a little bit of google research i realized that this was something i believed i could learn with dedication and will power. 

Before starting the online immersive, I never took on a challenge that would have developed me to become a 

professonal in any field of interest. I felt like i was a "Master at none"  and it was something that i really wanted to change. 

So far i must say starting this course did not only help me learn and gain some programming skills, but it helped me 

realize what it takes to truly accomplish any type of goal that i set for myself.

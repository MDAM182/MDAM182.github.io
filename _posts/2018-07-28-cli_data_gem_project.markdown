This was my first project and i must say that it was definitely chanlleging. I think the toughest part for me was 

understanding what i needed to scrape to get my cli working properly. I thought it would be cool to scrape the 

Pied Piper website from one of my favourite shows  *Silicon Valley*  [http://www.piedpiper.com/#team].  

It took me longer than i expected to complete this lab, which i was quite upset about at first lol , but i must say it was 

fun actually figureing out what i needed to fix to get it going. The time i took to complete to finish this project was well 

worth it to be honest because it helped me understand alot of concepts better which i definitely needed. If i had one 

thing to tell myself  from the begininng it would be to use the resources around you! I've gotten so much help from 

coaches, students, and not to forget google haha. I'm glad i've stuck through this far and will continue heading

forward in this journey. 


Be well,

Mike M

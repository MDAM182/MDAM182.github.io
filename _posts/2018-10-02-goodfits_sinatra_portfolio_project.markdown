Welcome to GoodFits ! 

So for my Sinatra portfolio project i decided to come up with a digital closet organizer app. 
bascially the idea was to develop a digital closet organizer that lets you add whatever you own in your actual closet as well as connect and get inspired by others. Evenutally i will update it so that it can track current location weather condtions, upload users photos, link social media accounts, and many more. But for now the basics of the app allows users to sign up/log in/ log out/ edit their own wardrobe/ as well as view other users wardrobes . I've always had an intrest in fashion so this idea made sense to me and drawn me into creating GoodFits!

Be Well,

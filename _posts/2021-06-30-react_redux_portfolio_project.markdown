## How Redux works
With Redux there is a store that holds the state of the application. Each component can access the state without having to send down props from one component to another.There are three building parts: actions, store, and reducers. 

* Actions are events
* Reducers are pure functions
* The store holds the application state

Middleware intercepts all actions dispatched from components before they are passed to the reducer function.

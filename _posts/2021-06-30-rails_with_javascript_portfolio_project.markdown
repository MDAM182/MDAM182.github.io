# Use the console!
### The developer console is your friend! It took me some time to understand how to use it, and tbh i still don't really know what i'm doing haha. I suppose that's the beauty of it, eventually it should stick right? I've definitely used it a lot more for this project and it wasn't for much. But it helped to see my console.log() load  or to see my fetch request in action and that's a start. So if i had to tell my younger self something it would be to try new things out often and early in programming , trial and error is how you will grow!
